# Employees_website
 Company website which display table of employees, projects and assignments.
  Implemented pagination, search, sort and filter.
 I used Angular 13.0.1 framework as a frontend. 
 I used ASP.NET core Web API 6.0 to connect my Database and display it on the frontend.
 For Database I used Microsoft SQL Server.
 On this project I had to deal with lot of errors that encountered, learned troubleshooting and I somehow enjoyed debugging.
 I learned how to use ASP.NET core Web API and Angular framework 
 I enhenced my skills in SQL.

 NB: Due to Github timeout, I excluded "angular" file from Angualar framework, and "bin" file from ASP.NET core Web API
