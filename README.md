# Employees_website
 Company website which display table of employees, projects and assignments.
 I used Angular 13.0.1 framework as a frontend. 
 I used ASP.NET core Web API 6.0 to connect my Database and display it on the frontend.
 For Database I used Microsoft SQL Server.
 On project I had to deal with enormous errors that encountered, learned troubleshooting and I somehow enjoyed debugging.
 Learned more on ASP.NET core Web API and Angular. Enhenced my skills in SQL.

 NB: Due to Github timeout, I excluded "angular" file from Angualar framework, and "bin" file from ASP.NET core Web API
